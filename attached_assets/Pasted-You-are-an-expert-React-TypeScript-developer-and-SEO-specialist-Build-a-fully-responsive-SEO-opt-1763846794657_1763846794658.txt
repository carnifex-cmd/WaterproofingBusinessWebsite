Use react-helmet or react-helmet-async (preferred) to add SEO tags per page:

<title> specific to each page (e.g., “Terrace Waterproofing Services in Mumbai | Shri Siddhivinayak Waterproofing”)

<meta name="description" …> with relevant text

<meta name="keywords" …> (e.g., waterproofing services, terrace waterproofing, bathroom leakage repair, society building repairs, Mumbai)

Open Graph tags (og:title, og:description, og:type, og:url)

Add alt attributes for all images.

Use proper heading hierarchy:

One <h1> per page, then <h2>, <h3> for sub-sections.

Ensure mobile responsiveness and fast performance:

No excessively large images

Simple, clean components

Optionally add JSON-LD structured data for “LocalBusiness” or “Service” in a <script type="application/ld+json"> using Helmet.

Create a clean structure, for example:

src/

main.tsx or index.tsx

App.tsx

Footer.tsx

TestimonialCard.tsx

pages/
